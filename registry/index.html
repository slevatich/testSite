      <p>Truly, the best gift is your attendance! We recognize this is a long journey and big time commitment and are incredibly thankful that you are able to celebrate with us. If you feel compelled to give beyond that, we are planning to take two larger trips in 2026 (seeing Bad Bunny in Japan (!!) and returning to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland (!!)) and set a fund up where you can help offset those costs. Inspired by what little stores sometimes do with tip jars, this also gives you the opportunity to vote on which trip you are more excited for us to take (we will manually update this page with a little graphic shortly - just the percentage of people who prefer each option!). We feel blessed to have much of the kitchenware and other types of things that tend to go on registries and again, your attendance is the truest gift, but we would be honored and think of you as we enjoy these adventures :)</p>
