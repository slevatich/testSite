      <br>

      <p>We have welcome bags in the rooms, if you do not get one let us know. The oxxo (convenience store 24hr) 1.5 blocks away will have any essentials you've forgotten, and the Hilton has a little shop too</p>
<br>

<p>Many US phone plans have mexico data included. If you need some, you can buy an esim at the aforementioned convenience store and add it as a data sim to your phone</p>
<br>

<p>If you need pesos there is a bank near the hotel. Mimi and I are also happy to dispense some cash if you venmo us</p>
<br>

<p>In terms of tequila to buy, there's not really a notion of bottles that are only available in Mexico - what you will get is good quality brands (jose cuervo reserva de la familia, herradura, 1800) and fun shaped bottles at fantastic prices. You'll try plenty of good options at the wedding (for example: jose cuervo reserva de la familia, herradura, 1800)</p>
<br>

<p>Pinterests are now up on the website finally if you need outfit inspo. Our map (above) has some recs, but in particular heading to the norteno boots place (also has hats) and asking for Juan or Jose saying you're here for Boda Sam y Mimi will get you a good price</p>
<br>

<p>Apparently the hotel pool is pretty good! Feel free to bring a swimsuit. Packing this is optional, your passport is not.</p>
<br>

<p>Pace yourself at the wedding. It goes a while. You do not need to pregame this one :)</p>
<br>

<p>Tag us in social media things you post! Well really tag mimi she is the one who will see them and then show Sam later</p>
<br>

<p>If you want to request a song we recommend <s>having your own wedding</s> asking through Sam and Mimi who love you and have probably already put the song in your heart on the queue ;)</p>
<br>

<p>For the Saturday event, also pace yourself. This is at Loretito, where Mimi's dad grew up. Animal lovers, do not pet the stray dogs. Depending on which way the wind blows, you might get whiffs of farm animals</p>

<h3>Random AGU Tips and Tricks</h3>
	<h4>- To feel like a local, don't buckle your seatbelt when in the back of ubers and taxis! Pero, front seat si</h4>
	<h4>- Don't be alarmed if you see police with their lights flashing, they keep them flashing all the time. We have no idea how you tell if they are actually trying to pull you over…</h4>
	<h4>- Tip == Propina. Here its typically 10%. If the food is good, we give 15%! The food is almost always good, thus 15% is a safe bet. For the events its nice to have cash to tip waiters. 20-100 pesos would be a standard cash tip for these situations but feel free to be more generous.</h4>
	<h4>- Don't drink tap water, which is general advice for traveling pretty much anywhere. Restaurants are very good about using and serving bottled / filtered water, even for ice. If you are extra worried or have a super sensitive stomach, you can always ask for bottled water or get a nice shot of tequila</h4>
	<h4>- Have some change for bathrooms, in public spaces they will be extremely cheap but not free. They will give you sometimes an amount of toilet paper to bring in. You can always ask for more</h4>
	<h4>- As you come in from the airport keep an eye out for the Catrina mural / statue / monument. While its now a common symbol for mexico generally, the Catrina figure originated in aguascalientes!</h4>
