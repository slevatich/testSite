      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>Where do I RSVP? Is this website even finished??</h2>
      <p>All great questions, though you don't have to be so rude with that second one! Now that invites are in the mail, all necessary features are present (namely the RSVP form) but we plan to add additional fun features until the wedding! At the end of the RSVP form there is a field where you can fill in your email to be updated on when we add something new. If you aren't sure if you are on the list there is no harm in adding that email again, you'll never get more than one email per update!</p>
      <!-- Could add the email field here too if I wanted... -->
      <!-- <div class="emailSubmission">
        <br>
        <input type="text">
        <button onclick="">Submit</button>
      </div> -->
      <!-- <h2>Do you have a registry?</h2>
      <p>The greatest gift would be you traveling all this way to celebrate us (and preparing by listening to the playlists Sam bombards you with). We may add a tab for ways you can optionally contribute if you so desire, but that would show up along with the other in progress website features in time for the arrival of your invitation.</p> -->
      <h2>Are Plus Ones Allowed? What about kids?</h2>
      <p>All plus ones and kids welcome should be specifically noted on your invitation and show up in your attendees list when you RSVP through the form on the homepage. Number of kids is unfortunately limited due to wedding venue restrictions - we've had to be very precise! If you think we have made a mistake, please reach out!</p>
      <!-- <h2>I already know I can't make these dates! In between my bouts of sadness about this, what should I do?</h2>
      <p>If you do know ahead of time that this date will for sure not work for you please let us know! This helps us keep an accurate count of attendees. No need to cry, we appreciate you!</p> -->
