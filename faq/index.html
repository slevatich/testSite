      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <h2>Where do I RSVP? Is this website even finished??</h2>
      <p>All great questions, though you don't have to be so rude with that second one! Many fun and necessary features (RSVP form, better rendering for mobile, there's a long list) be added to the website before invitations arrive sometime this fall. As you might be able to tell, we are handrolling this website so we appreciate your patience while Sam finds time to do website coding. If you would like to receive little updates when these things show up you can add your email here:</p>
      <div class="emailSubmission">
        <br>
        <input type="text">
        <button onclick="">Submit</button>
      </div>
      <h2>Do you have a registry?</h2>
      <p>The greatest gift would be you traveling all this way to celebrate us (and preparing by listening to the playlists Sam bombards you with). We may add a tab for ways you can optionally contribute if you so desire, but that would show up along with the other in progress website features in time for the arrival of your invitation</p>
      <h2>Are Plus Ones Allowed? What about kids?</h2>
      <p>All plus ones and kids welcome should be specifically noted on your invitation. This is unfortunately limited due to wedding venue restrictions - we've had to be very precise! If you think we have made a mistake, please reach out!</p>
      <h2>I already know I can't make these dates! In between my bouts of sadness about this, what should I do?</h2>
      <p>If you do know ahead of time that this date will for sure not work for you please let us know! This helps us keep an accurate count of attendees.</p>
