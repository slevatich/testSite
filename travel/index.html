      <br>
      <p>Mexico, and Aguascalientes in particular, is a very special place to Mimi that has become special to Sam throughout the course of their relationship. Aguascalientes is where both of Mimi's parents grew up and where Mimi has spent most of her Decembers. It is not a huge tourist location, but that is part of what makes it so special. We can promise delicious food, beautiful classic architecture, affordable shopping, and a chance to practice your Spanish (unlike more touristy spots, you will run into folks who will not be able to hop into English at your first sign of struggle!)</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is, naturally, an <b>international</b> wedding. This means you will need to make sure your passport has not expired. The current estimated time is 4 weeks but we would not recommend leaving this to chance or the last minute. If you take a minute to check your passport if your expiration date is further out than February 2026 you should be safe, but ideally you want an expiration date of at least 6 months out from your travel dates. Currently no additional visa is required to enter Mexico. We will update you if entry requirements change in any way.</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Hotels / Lodging</h1>
      <p>We have a block reserved at the Hilton Garden Inn Aguascalientes for 1/22-1/25 (3 nights) that can be accessed via the link below until January 8th 2026:</p>
      <h2><a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/attend-my-event/agugigi-bodams-992077ea-ddad-4f2a-bb1d-6b42db83cf2/">Reserve</a></h2>
      <p class="tinyText">(NOTE: don't be alarmed the prices are in pesos, divide by 20 to get approximate dollar amount or use the dropdown to change currency)</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is the only hotel we will have a block reserved for for ease of coordinating shuttles, which will run from this hotel to every event for the weekend. The Hilton is in an area with other hotels so feel free to research other hotels nearby or airbnbs, which could be fun if you coordinate in a group. This is a nice safe area with lots of restaurants and bars so we recommend trying to stay nearby if not at the Hilton for that reason in addition to ease of getting to the shuttle pickup and dropoff.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The block currently only allows you to book Thursday-Saturday: we are working with the hotel to support extending the dates but for now just book through their website outside the block. January is low season so the prices should not change much. The only thing we ask if you book outside the block is to send us a message with your reservation number / travel plan: this is so we could get you your little welcome gift :)</p>


      <!-- <p>There are of course other hotels but we can't vouch for them and you'll need to uber to the events (or to/from the Hilton for shuttle catching). Based on a quick google maps hunt there are options for <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zVYH7k2oucfspYnr9">intrepid ultra low budget</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9jG4ZNS5wcHzFLum9">marriott loyal people</a>, and even <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/R4iMr3y8WnC7667KA">a resort</a> (at approximately normal US hotel prices!). All this said, the Hilton is <b>strongly recommended</b> for US guests and we expect most of you will be staying there (and they have the space to accomodate this!).</p> -->

      <!-- <p>We are still figuring out blocks for hotels but that info will be posted here shortly! The block will have rooms for Thursday night to Sunday morning, which will ensure ability to make everything comfortably on the schedule. Shuttles will run from the hotel to all events, so if you stay elsewhere you will be responsable for getting ubers or other rideshares. Based on our investigations, the hotel price should not exceed 100$ total for all nights.</p> -->
      <!-- <p>We are still figuring out blocks for hotels but expect the price to be around 60$ per room per night and will probably include a Hilton and Marriott near the venue. The block has rooms for Thursday night to Sunday morning, which will ensure ability to make everything comfortably on the schedule. Shuttles will run from the Hilton only, so pick that one for maximum convenience, but for a more nontraditional pick we've scoped out a few different other options as well:</p> -->
      <!-- 80$ for the 3 nights. 20 / extra person TODO: remove price and say just one block hotel -->

      <h1>Getting Here</h1>
      <p>We highly recommend flying directly into Aguascalientes International Airport (AGU) and then taking a rideshare/taxi to the hotel directly from there - an uber would be around 15$ USD. We will also explore touching base with the hotel about setting up shuttle pickup times from the airport if enough people cluster on matching flights. Its a tiny airport and will probably involve a connection if traveling from the US, but the staff speak English, immigration is very quick, and it is safer to fly directly into the city as opposed to flying into a larger city airport and taking a bus. If you really want to fly into another airport and bus, just ensure the bus travel is during the day and you have some knowledge of Spanish - bus stations are less likely to have english speaking staff.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Based on our schedule of events we recommend getting in Thursday evening and leaving anytime Sunday. Prices will only go up from this point so we recommend booking now!</p>

      <h1>Exploring</h1>
      <p>Having spent a lot of time in Aguas we have a lot of recommendations of stuff to do! Check back here as we will be uploading some recommendations of what to do as the wedding approaches (if you give your email at the end of the RSVP form, this is one of those things where we will send an email when we add this part)</p>
      <!--  Here are some flights we recommend from the Seattle area - if not coming from there maybe the connecting flights info will still be valuable -->
      <!-- If you book in a timely manner your round trip shouldn't exceed 750$.  -->
      <!-- <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">American Airlines connecting through Dallas</div></div>
      <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">United through Houston</div></div>
      <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Volaris</div></div>
      <p>Note: Volaris is going to look very tempting with its low costs, but they will get you with additional fees and upcharges if you aren't careful. Only pick this option if you are comfortable with low cost international airlines and/or traveling light.</p> -->
      <!-- <h1>Extending Your Stay</h1>
      <p>Why not make an adventure of it! You won't be going to a significantly different time zone but there are so many beautiful spots in Mexico you could choose to bookend your trip with. Here are some of our favorites:</p>
      <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Cancun</div></div>
      <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Puerto Vallarta</div></div>
      <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">CDMX</div></div>
      <br>
      <p>Note: the bride and groom will be decamping to cancun following the wedding and you are welcome to join them! It's not their official honeymoon so you won't be crashing anything. You will have to pretend it is their honeymoon though because they will be saying it is to get perks from the resort B)</p> -->
