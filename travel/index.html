    <h1>Bienvenidos a Mexico!</h1>
    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="500" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Aguas Photo</div></div>
    <br>
    <p>Mexico, and Aguascalientes in particular, is a very special place to Mimi that has become special to Sam throughout the course of their relationship. Aguascalientes is where both of Mimi's parents grew up and is a relatively small city despite being the capital of it's state, also named Aguascalientes. It is not a huge tourist location, but that is part of what makes it so special and authentic. We can promise delicious food, beautiful classic architecture, cheap shopping, and a chance to practice your Spanish (unlike more touristy spots, you will run into folks who will not be able to hop into English at your first sign of struggle!)</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is, naturally, an <b>international</b> wedding. This means you will need to renew your passport. The current estimated time is 4 weeks but we would not recommend leaving this to chance / the last minute. Currently no additional visa is required to enter Mexico. We will update you if entry requirements change in any way.</p>

    <h1>Hotels / Lodging</h1>
    <p>We are still figuring out blocks for hotels but expect the price to be around 60$ per room per night and will probably include a Hilton and Marriott near the venue. The block has rooms for Thursday night to Sunday morning, which will ensure ability to make everything comfortably on the schedule. Shuttles will run from the Hilton only, so pick that one for maximum convenience, but for a more nontraditional pick we've scoped out a few different other options as well:</p>

    <h1>Getting Here</h1>
    <p>We highly recommend flying directly into Aguascalientes International Airport (AGU) and then taking a rideshare/taxi to the hotel directly from there. Its a tiny airport and will probably involve a connection if traveling from the US, but it is safer to fly directly into the see as opposed to flying into a larger city airport and taking a bus. If you book in a timely manner your round trip shouldn't exceed 750$. Here are some flights we recommend from the Seattle area - if not coming from there maybe the connecting flights info will still be valuable</p>

    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">United through Houston</div></div>
    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Volaris</div></div>
    <p>Note: Volaris is going to look very tempting with its low costs, but they will get you with additional fees and upcharges if you aren't careful. Only pick this option if you are comfortable with low cost international airlines and/or traveling light.</p>
    <h1>Extending Your Stay</h1>
    <p>Why not make an adventure of it! You won't be going to a significantly different time zone but there are so many beautiful spots in Mexico you could choose to bookend your trip with. Here are some of our favorites:</p>
    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Cancun</div></div>
    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">Puerto Vallarta</div></div>
    <div class="fakeImgCon"><img width="300" height="300"><div class="fakeImg">CDMX</div></div>
    <br>
    <p>Note: the bride and groom will be decamping to cancun following the wedding and you are welcome to join them! It's not their official honeymoon so you won't be crashing anything. You will have to pretend it is their honeymoon though because they will be saying it is to get perks from the resort B)</p>
